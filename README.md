# DotnetBootcamp

A repository I used for developing projects for my .NET Bootcamp during my first year of university. I copied the projects into their own repositories for more convenient viewing:

FileManager - <https://github.com/xxamii/FileManager>
TestingFramework - <https://github.com/xxamii/TestingFramework>
